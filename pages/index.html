            <p>Nash equilibrium is a concept within game theory where the optimal outcome of a game is one where no
                player has an incentive to deviate from his or her chosen strategy after considering an opponent's
                choice. Overall, an individual can receive no incremental benefit from changing actions, assuming other
                players remain constant in their strategies.</p>
